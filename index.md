## About Me

Dr. Jason (Dayong) Wu is working with the Texas A&M Transportation Institute (TTI) as an Associate Research Scientist at the Research and Implementation Division/Dallas Program. Prior to joining TTI, Dr. Wu worked as a senior research associate at Texas Tech University (TTU) as part of the Texas Tech University Center for Multidisciplinary Research in Transportation (TechMRT). Dr. Wu has about 10-year solid experience in various research projects such as Traffic Safety, Intelligent Transportation Systems, Big Data Analytics, Machine Learning, GIS in Transportation, and Traffic Mobility and Operation Analysis. He has been involved in a five-year safety education program for teen drivers in the rural areas of West Texas. He has also developed several web GIS-based applications in pavement and bridge management using advanced geo-spatial data visualization and integration technologies. Currently, he is leading a Safe-D UTC project that focuses on improving work zone safety by using emerging 3D LiDAR sensing technologies.

Dr. Wu received his doctorate in transportation engineering at TTU and his Master's in structural engineering at Utah State University (USU). He has also authored and co-authored 40 journal papers and conference proceedings on various transportation research topics since 2013.
